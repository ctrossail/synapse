<h2>Why use Glial?</h2>

<h3>BUILD APPLICATIONS QUICKLY</h3>
Many common components are included: translation tools, database access, code profiling, encryption, validation, and more.

<h3>USE SPECIFIC LIBRARIES AND TOOLS</h3>
Extending existing components and adding new libraries is very easy.

<h3>WRITE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</h3>
Uses the GNU/GPL license, so you can use and modify it for commercial purposes.

<h3>A VERY FAST FRAMEWORK</h3>
Benchmarking a framework is hard and rarely reflects the real world, but Glial is very efficient and carefully optimized for real world usage.

<h3>GOOD DEBUGGING AND PROFILING TOOLS</h3>
Simple and effective tools help identify and solve performance issues quickly.

<h3>KNOW WHAT THE FRAMEWORK IS DOING</h3>
Very well commented code and a simple routing structure makes it easy to understand what is happening.

<h3>WORK WITH OBJECTS AND CLASSES</h3>
This is an OOP framework that is extremely DRY. Everything is built using strict PHP 5 classes and objects.

<h3>WRITE YOUR OWN CODE</h3>
There are no code generators and endless configuration files, so setting up is fast and easy.

<h3>COMMUNITY SUPPORT</h3>
A very active community forum and IRC channel means that most questions are answered very quickly.
